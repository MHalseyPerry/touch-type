# Touch Type [WIP]

A website to practice touch typing in any language, built using React. The current build only supports the Cyrillic and English alphabets, other languages will be added soon by myself however if anyone would like to contribute by adding other lanugage support it can be done relativly easily by adding to the useKeymaps hook.
